<h1 style="text-align: center;">Pre-History</h1>
<p>
    The start of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) timeline is a complex and interconnected web of events that lay the groundwork for the entire franchise. The earliest event in the MCU timeline is the formation of the universe itself, which occurred roughly 13.8 billion years ago. This event, however, is not explicitly shown in the MCU.
</p>

<p>Beings of infinite cosmic power, the Celestials — led by Arishem the Judge — created the original planets, stars, and lifeforms of the infant universe following the Big Bang.
</p>

<p>
    The next major event is the creation of the Infinity Stones. The Stones were formed from the remnants of six singularities that existed before the universe as we know it came into being. The Stones were forged into six powerful objects: the Space Stone, the Mind Stone, the Reality Stone, the Power Stone, the Time Stone, and the Soul Stone. These Stones play a central role in the MCU's overarching story, and many of the franchise's films revolve around their acquisition, use, and destruction.

<p>The cosmic entity known as the First Firmament, who was the embodiment of the universe before the current one, created the Celestials as a way to protect and regulate the universe.</p>
<p>
    The Celestials are responsible for the creation of the Infinity Stones, which are some of the most powerful objects in the MCU. It is suggested that the Stones were created by the Celestials using the power of the universe itself, and that they have played a key role in many of the major events in the franchise.
</p>
<p>In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the Celestials are an ancient race of powerful cosmic beings who have existed for millions of years. According to MCU lore, the Celestials were among the first beings to emerge in the universe after the Big Bang, and they played a key role in shaping the cosmos.

    The Celestials are said to be extremely powerful, with the ability to manipulate energy, matter, and even time itself. They are also known for their immense size, with some Celestials reaching heights of several miles. Despite their power and size, the Celestials are known to be reclusive and mysterious, rarely appearing to other races or interacting directly with the universe they helped create.

    In the MCU, the Celestials are known to have planted embryonic Celestials inside some planets, including Earth. These embryonic Celestials are believed to be a source of immense power and energy.

According to MCU lore, the embryonic Celestials are a part of the Celestials' grand plan for the universe. When a planet reaches a certain level of development, the Celestials will activate the embryonic Celestial inside it, causing it to consume the planet and convert its energy into more Celestials. This process is known as the "hostile takeover," and it is believed to be the ultimate fate of all planets that have an embryonic Celestial inside them.

These new Celestials would be born once sentient life on each planet rose to a critical juncture, allowing for the Emergence of a new Celestial and resulting in the destruction of that world. To assist in this process, the Celestials genetically engineered Deviant monsters to wipe out the apex predators of each world, encouraging sentient life to develop and multiply.

Unfortunately, the Celestials miscalculated. The Deviants did their job so well they started hunting down and killing all lifeforms, preventing Emergences. To keep them in check, the Celestials created the Eternals, synthetic lifeforms sent to different worlds across the cosmos to kill the Deviants and protect the planet's lifeforms. Regarded as gods and superheroes by the populace, the Celestials are unknowingly preparing the planets for their destruction. Following each Emergence, the Eternals memories are wiped so they could be reused on different worlds.

<p> Ego was created as a "seed" by the Celestial known as "The Progenitor." This seed eventually became the Celestial Ego, and over time, he gained consciousness and began to explore the universe.

    As Ego traveled through the cosmos, he realized that he had a unique ability to manipulate matter and energy, and he began to experiment with his powers. He eventually discovered that he could plant extensions of himself on different planets and use them to tap into the planets' energy, as well as manipulate them to his will.
    
    Ego's ultimate goal was to find a way to expand his consciousness across the entire universe, and to accomplish this, he began to search for a compatible mate with whom he could create offspring. 

    However, Ego's ambition led him down a dark path, and he became a ruthless and megalomaniacal villain. He was willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to achieve his goals, and he viewed himself as the only being worthy of ruling the universe.

    Elsewhere the Dark Elves emerge who are an ancient race of beings who were once the rulers of the Nine Realms, including Asgard. However, their thirst for power and domination led them to attempt to use the Aether, one of the six Infinity Stones, to plunge the universe into eternal darkness and start a new age of the universe under their rule.

    The Dark Elves were led by Malekith, their king, who wielded the powerful weapon known as the Dark Elf Sword. Malekith was obsessed with the idea of bringing back the universe's former state of darkness, known as the "Great Darkness," and believed that by using the Aether, he could achieve this goal.


    Odins Father — Bor led Asgard's armies against the Dark Elves in a war that lasted for millennia. The conflict came to a head when Bor led a final battle against the Dark Elf leader Malekith, in which he was able to defeat him and his army. It was said that Bor's victory was so complete that it drove the surviving Dark Elves into hiding.

Bor's victory over the Dark Elves is significant because it allowed Asgard to become the dominant power in the Nine Realms. It also set the stage for the events of the movie, as Malekith seeks revenge on Asgard for their defeat by attempting to use the Aether to plunge the universe into eternal darkness.

The battle resulted in the apparent destruction of the Aether and the majority of the Dark Elves, with only Malekith and a small group of his followers surviving by escaping through a portal to an unknown location.
