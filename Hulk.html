The Hulk is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe. His real name is Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a brilliant scientist who was exposed to gamma radiation which caused him to transform into a giant, green-skinned monster whenever he gets angry or stressed. As the Hulk, Banner has superhuman strength and endurance, and is virtually invulnerable.
The Hulk is known for his uncontrollable rage, which makes him difficult to control and a danger to those around him. However, Banner has also learned to use his transformation to his advantage, using the Hulk's strength to fight against various villains and threats. He is also a member of the Avengers, a team of superheroes that includes Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and others.
In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Hulk is portrayed by actor Mark Ruffalo and has appeared in several films, including The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame.
