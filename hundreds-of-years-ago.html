<p>
    Around 500 years ago Fen and her village soon grew ill with smallpox brought on by the Spanish conquistadors that invaded their land and farms. Their god, Chaac gave their shaman a vision. The shaman traveled and found a Talokanil Herb, which could save them.
    Fen was skeptical of the cure due to her pregnancy. However, she was assured that her son would be a leader of the new world. She took the herb and passed out. She woke up to find herself blue and in need of breathing. They ran to the water as they now needed it to draw oxygen as they were turned into the first Talokanil.
    They started a new civilization called Talokan underwater and soon found Vibranium. Fen then gave birth to her son, Ch'ah Toh Almehen, who was a mutant with special abilities.
    Per his mother's wishes, Ch'ah Toh Almehen came to the surface with other Talokanil to bury her. They saw many Mayan people being treated abused as if they were slaves. Distraught, Almehen flew up into the air, scaring the settlers, who shot at him. Namor did not care as he still flew, ordering the Talokanil to burn the village.
    Namor coldly watched as many settlers died and the village was burned. He then helped dig a hole in the ground, burying Fen, sticking an object in her mouth. A dying priest derisively called Ch'ah Toh Almehen, "El Ni√±o sin Amor", meaning "the child without love," which Ch'ah Toh Almehen took that as his name, Namor, as a warning to his enemies. This experience showed him how bad the surface world was and that he needed to protect his kind from it.
