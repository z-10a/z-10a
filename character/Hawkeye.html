Hawkeye is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe. His real name is Clint Barton and he is a skilled archer and marksman, as well as a member of the Avengers. He was orphaned at a young age and grew up in a carnival, where he learned his archery skills. Eventually, he became a criminal, but was later recruited by the Avengers and became a superhero.
Hawkeye is known for his expert marksmanship and his use of trick arrows, which are arrows with specialized tips that allow him to perform a variety of tasks, such as exploding or emitting smoke. He is also skilled in hand-to-hand combat and is known for his acrobatic abilities. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he is portrayed by actor Jeremy Renner and has appeared in several films, including The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Avengers: Endgame, as well as the Disney+ series Hawkeye.
