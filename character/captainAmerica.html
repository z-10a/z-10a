Captain America is a fictional superhero character in the Marvel Comics universe. He was created by writer Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby and first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 in 1941.
The character's alter ego is Steve Rogers, a frail young man who is transformed into a super-soldier through a top-secret government experiment during World War II. Captain America's enhanced strength, agility, and endurance, combined with his iconic shield, make him a formidable opponent against his enemies.
Captain America has been featured in numerous comic book series, as well as in a number of television shows, movies, and video games. He is a founding member of the Avengers, a team of superheroes that includes Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk, among others.
The character has become a cultural icon and is considered one of the most patriotic superheroes in American pop culture. Chris Evans played the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which began with the film Captain America: The First Avenger in 2011.
