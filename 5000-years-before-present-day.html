    <p>
        Around 5000 years ago a group of ancient aliens known as the Kree visited Earth and experimented on early humans using the Terrigen Mist. These experiments resulted in the creation of the first Inhumans, who were granted powerful abilities such as super strength, agility, and telekinesis.
       One of these Inhumans, known as "Hive," drives the Kree from the Earth and establishes a cult of personality that regards him as a god. After being banished, his followers work to restore him while destabilizing Earth society. Over time, this society becomes the terrorist organization HYDRA.

   Moving to just about a thousand years before the present day, the warlord Xu Wenwu makes a fantastic discovery of his own when he comes across 10 otherworldly rings that grant him immortality and the strength of a god. Using the rings to establish his Ten Rings criminal organization, Wenwu conquers kingdoms and topples governments, amassing an incredible power structure that influences the direction of the world.
   However, the rings have also corrupted him, causing him to become obsessed with power and control.
   It was heavily suggested that Wenwu was the ancient warlord known as Ghengis Khan, he even refers to himself as the great Khan at one point, but it is never outright confirmed. Coincidentally, Wenwu found the Ten Rings and came to power right around the time Ghengis Khan ruled over much of southeast Asia.

    Over in Eastern Europe, the demonic entity Chthon writes The Darkhold, an ancient book of dark spells, on a castle at the top of Mount Wungadore. The original text is then copied onto a more portable book that falls into the hands of several dark magic users, including the witch Morgan le Fay.

    The Kree see the Skrulls as a threat to their expansionist ambitions and launch a campaign to wipe them out. The Skrulls, meanwhile, are determined to survive and fight back against the Kree's aggression.

    The war is shown to have devastating consequences for both sides, with countless lives lost and entire planets destroyed in the fighting. This war goes on for many centuries.
