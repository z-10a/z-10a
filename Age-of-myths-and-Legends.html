    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Age of myths and Legends</h1>

    <p>
        The dawn of superheroes happened in 5000 BC when ten immortal Eternals — Sersi, Ikaris, Ajak, Kingo, Sprite, Phastos, Makkari, Thena, Druig, and Gilgamesh — arrived on Earth to take out the Deviants on our planet.
        For thousands of years, the Eternals protected emerging humankind, largely through epic super battles with the Deviants.

        Since the Celestials have instructed the Eternals not to interfere in humanity unless Deviants were involved, other god-like beings get the chance to descend onto Earth and have their time to shine. These include the Asgardians, vastly powerful alien beings who visit our planet many times and give rise to Norse mythology. The most notable character to do this is Odin.

        Hela is the eldest child of Odin and the goddess of death. She was born and raised in Asgard.

        As depicted in the movie, Hela's origins are intertwined with those of Asgard itself. It is revealed that Asgard was not always the peaceful realm that it is known as in the present day. In the past, Asgard was a conquering empire that waged war across the Nine Realms. Hela was Odin's weapon of choice during this time, serving as his executioner and leading his armies to victory.
        
        During this era, the magic warhammer Mjolnir is forged in the heart of a dying star, and used by Hela.

        
        As Hela became more powerful and bloodthirsty, Odin grew to fear her and sought to rein in her ambitions.

        Hela slaughters the Valkyrior that Odin sent after her. The sole surviving Valkyrie flees from Asgard, spending the next few thousand years drunk and depressed. 

        
        He banished her from Asgard and sealed her away in a prison hidden beneath the realm. It is said that Odin had to use all of his power to imprison Hela, which drained him and left him weakened.

        A vibranium meteorite crashed into Wakanda over a million years ago. The impact created a mountain that became known as the "Mound of Vibranium," and the energy released by the impact caused the metal to spread throughout the region. 

        Much later, this area becomes the country of Wakanda when a "warrior shaman" receives a vision from the goddess Bast and founds a dynasty of kings known as the Black Panthers. The Wakandans become secretive and isolationist, remaining unconquered throughout history and using vibranium to create fantastic technology, away from the eyes of the outside world.
        the meteorite is said to have brought the first Black Panther to Wakanda, who then became the country's first king. The vibranium is also said to have a spiritual significance for the Wakandans, who believe that it is a gift from the gods and that it is their responsibility to protect and use it wisely.

        Odin and Frigga have a son, Thor.
        At some point in the past, Odin led a massive assault on Jotunheim, defeating the Frost Giants and confiscating the Casket of Ancient Winters, a powerful artifact that grants control over the forces of cold and ice.

        The exact details of the battle are not shown onscreen, but it is clear that it was a brutal and hard-fought conflict that established Asgard's dominance over the Frost Giants.
        Odin defeats the frost giant Laufey and adopts his son, Loki, as his own.
        The Casket of Ancient Winters was taken back to Asgard as a war trophy and was kept under tight security in Odin's vault.
